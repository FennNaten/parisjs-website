Everytime you discover a new framework or library, you have to spend time in its documentation. If you've recently used React, React Native, Eslint or Yarn you might have noticed that they have an ultra fast and relevant searchbar to let you find your content easily.

They are using DocSearch, a entirely free product, that automatically crawl a documentation website every 24h, coupled with a tiny JS library to display results in a dropdown menu.

In this talk I will explain how DocSearch works internally, and how you can easily add it to your own documentation.
