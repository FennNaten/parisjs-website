This talk is about how we build & deploy a complex AngularJS/TypeScript app in production at Aircall.

I will describe what happens between a git push production command and the release of it (Webpack build, tests & AWS CodeDeploy).

I will release a new Aircall feature in live, during the talk.
As we use a continuous integration and delivery platform, the talk will be animated with the life cycle of a build.
