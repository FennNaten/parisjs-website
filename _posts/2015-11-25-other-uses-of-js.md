A talk about my journey into "creative technology" field with different projects I did, tools I use, and how JS fits into all of that.

I'm freelance creative technologist and audiovisual artist, I do everything ranging from clear d3-style data-visualisations, through abstract data-art, to crazy things like interactive and kinetic installations. Most of the stuff I do is powered by JS (although lately I've been switching to clojure).
